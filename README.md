# DL-image-Colorisation
This project uses a Convolutional Autoencoder for automatic image colorization. Trained on the Kaggle dataset, it predicts color channels from grayscale inputs. The model achieved an SSIM of 0.8768 and PSNR of 22.84, showing high-quality results. Future work includes integrating GANs/Transformers and adding a real-time colorization UI.
